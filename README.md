# My PyTorch for Deep Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal work and code as I follow along with the excellent ["PyTorch for Deep Learning"](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) course by Daniel Bourke. My goal is to replicate the course materials from scratch to build a strong foundation in PyTorch and fundamental deep learning concepts.

This project is for my personal learning and to showcase my progress in mastering PyTorch.

## Key Concepts & Learnings

Throughout this course, I am focusing on understanding and implementing the following core concepts:

*   **Tensors:** The fundamental data structure in PyTorch.
*   **Computational Graphs:** How PyTorch builds and executes models.
*   **`torch.nn`:** Building neural network layers and models.
*   **`torch.utils.data.Dataset` & `DataLoader`:** Creating custom data pipelines for training.
*   **Loss Functions & Optimizers:** The mechanics of model training.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance with various metrics.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Leveraging CUDA for faster training.
*   **Transfer Learning:** Using pre-trained models to solve new problems.
*   **Model Deployment:** Making a trained model available for inference.

## Setup & Usage

To run any of the notebooks in this repository, you will need to have PyTorch and other relevant libraries installed.

```bash
# It is recommended to create a virtual environment first
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
